# Biodome

Informatics reporting and analysis web site.

## The Tech

The "glue code" libraries being used:

* [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/) for HTTP serving and server JS moduling.
* [Node Package Manager](https://npmjs.org/) for server JS package managing.
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) for source controlling.
* [Express JS](http://www.expressjs.com/) for javascript web application structuring.
* [Jade](http://www.jade-lang.com/) for server side templating.
* [Angular JS](http://angularjs.org/) for client side MVCing.
* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for client side web developing.
* [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com/) for server and client JS building and tasking.
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) for web package managing.
* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) for JS unit testing.
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) for unit test asserting.
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) for data storing.
* [MongGoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) for validation, casting and business logic boilerplating.

### Project Requirements

1) Install [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) (NPM comes with node).

2) Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

3) Clone the `biodome` repository:

    git clone git@github.com:jumpjet71/biodome.git

4) [Download MongoDB]( http://www.mongodb.org/downloads/).

5) [Install MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/).

### Project Setup

From the `biodome` project directory , run the following from the command line:

1) Install [Grunt CLI](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli/) and the [Bower CLI](http://sindresorhus.com/bower-components/) global dependencies:

	npm install grunt-cli bower -g

2) Install all of the local client side JavaScript dependencies:

	bower install

3) Install all of the local server side JavaScript dependencies:

	npm install

### Available Build, Test and Deploy Grunt Commands

There are a number of [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com/) based targets that are used for running different build tasks:

* `grunt build-debug` or `grunt`: To run tests locally and compile all of the CSS and JavaScript files into `/dist`.
* `grunt build`: To run tests locally ,compile and [UglifyJS](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/) the CSS and JavaScript into `/dist`.
* `grunt test`: Run all server js and all client JavaScript [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) unit tests headless in [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).
* `grunt watch`: This is a developer convenience method for watching JavaScript and CSS file and automatically building them whenever you save.

NOTE: [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) needs to be installed and running in order to run test tasks.

### Environmental Settings

There are three environments provided by default, `development`, `test`, and `production`.
Each of these environments has the following configuration options:

* `mongoDbUrl`: This is the url of the MongoDB database to use, and is set by default set to `mongodb://localhost/biodome-test` for the test environment.
* `app.name`: This is the name of your app or website, and can be different for each environment. You can tell which environment you are running by looking at the TITLE attribute that your app generates.

To run with a different environment, just specify `NODE_ENV` as you call grunt:

    $ NODE_ENV=test grunt

If you are using node directly instead of grunt, it is very similar:

    $ NODE_ENV=test node server

### Application Run Grunt Commands

After successfully running `grunt`, `grunt build-debug`, or `grunt test` you are ready to run the application.
The following commands set `NODE_ENV` with the appropriate environment, [Nodemon](http://nodemon.io/) for server side code monitoring.

* `grunt run-test-mode`: To run the application with test environment. (The running application URL will be: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))
* `grunt run-dev-mode`: To run the application with development environment. (The running application URL will be: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))

NOTE: [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) needs to be installed and running in order to run project.
